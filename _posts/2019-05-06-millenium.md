## Project Description

For our analysis of the Millennium Dance Complex we drew from and adjusted Sara Ahmed’s work "On Being Included". More specifically, we consider her analysis of what the language of diversity does and what it means to brand diversity. We take a look at MDC's mission statement, study some the dance vidoes MDC publishes online, and consider the dance industry as a whole. We wanted to begin to understand a potential relationship between the image of multiculturalism and inclusivity and commercialization. 

MDC attempts to facilitate an environment where viewers see different races, genders, ages, presentations and embodiments. The institution and industry of dance, dance-making, performance/entertainment is white and white dominated. Thus having certain bodies, documented on camera provides a counter narrative of this. However, the dancers who are most successful from MDC still overwhelmingly white/light women. 

Hip-hop was seen not as “real”, “sophisticated” dance in many ways because it began outside of the institution. Hip-hop is inextricably tied to blackness and black, urban culture. Millennium Dance Complex specializes in contemporary hip hop. So not only does Millennium brand itself as diverse through its mission statement/language and its "diverse" dancers (which in turn, create a diverse community), but it is encoded as diverse because of its specialization in a “diverse” or once “othered” dance form.

The language of the mission statement and the visual are mutually reinforcing. They say and show: we are diverse, we are inclusive, we prioritize diversity.
