title: 'RuPaul’s Race: Performing or Occulting Blackness in Drag'
category: ['2019']
excerpt: "For our final project, we created an Instagram to curate the legacy of Black queens who have appeared on RuPaul’s Drag Race. We are interested in exploring how Black drag queens respond to racism in the show and its fanbase, and how they interact with/subvert a camera that often attempts to reduce them to stereotypical roles."

      bio: "('20) is an Honors French major and English minor. She specializes in postcolonial literature and is particularly interested in gender and sexuality. Her interest in Cultural Studies was sparked by constant traveling between the U.S, where she was raised, and France, where her larger family resides. She is new to the world of Drag Race and finds RuPaul slightly terrifying."

      bio: "('19) is an English major and Theater minor. She is interested in performance, representation, and how subjects of color contest with white supremacist ways of seeing. She wonders if these contestations can be accurately theorized from her position as a non-Black scholar and invites additional interventions. She has watched 14 seasons of Drag Race and is working on her 15th."

## Project

Our Instagram is a visual timeline of Black drag queens who have appeared on RuPaul’s Drag Race. We study how they interact and stage their Blackness for/against the reality tv cameras. How do Black queens reclaim their narratives, or fail to do so? How does the show itself interact with issues of race and ethnicity, or avoid them? Our project will culminate in a study of Season 10’s “Vixen” controversy, in which Black queen The Vixen openly denounced racism in the show’s fanbase and its editing and portrayal of Black queens; we will especially study how the Vixen’s viral comments led other former contestants of color to come forth with their own stories of racial discrimination, paving the way for a wider conversation about racism and colorism in queer communities.  

Our project will use as primary sources the social media accounts of Black performers who have appeared on *RuPaul’s Drag Race*. We will also rely on the show itself, though our analysis will focus mostly on Season 10 and the controversy around the Vixen, and episodes of *Untucked*, Drag Race’s “sister show” in which the contestants address each other in a supposedly more unformal and less staged environement than in the performances themselves. Our secondary sources include Tavia Amolo Ochieng’ Nyongó’s 2018 book *Afro-Fabulations: The Queer Drama of Black Life* [^1] and bell hooks’ analysis of Black drag in the “Is Paris Burning?” chapter of her 1996 book *Reel to Real* [^2].
