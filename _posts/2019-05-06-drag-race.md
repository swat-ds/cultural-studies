title: 'RuPaul’s Race: Performing or Occulting Blackness in Drag'
category: ['2019']
excerpt: "Our Instagram is a visual timeline of Black drag queens who have appeared on RuPaul’s Drag Race. We study how they interact and stage their Blackness for/against the reality tv cameras. How do Black queens reclaim their narratives, or fail to do so? How does the show itself interact with issues of race and ethnicity, or avoid them? Our project will culminate in a study of Season 10’s “Vixen” controversy, in which Black queen The Vixen openly denounced racism in the show's fanbase and its editing and portrayal of Black queens; we will especially study how the Vixen’s viral comments led other former contestants of color to come forth with their own stories of racial discrimination, paving the way for a wider conversation about racism and colorism in queer communities."

## Project

Our project will use as primary sources the social media accounts of
Black performers who have appeared on RuPaul’s Drag Race. We will
also rely on the show itself, though our analysis will focus mostly on
Season 10 and the controversy around the Vixen, and episodes of

Untucked, Drag Race’s “sister show” in which the contestants address
each other in a supposedly more unformal and less staged environement
than in the performances themselves. Our secondary sources include
Tavia Amolo Ochieng’ Nyongó’s 2018 book “Afro-Fabulations: The Queer
Drama of Black Life” and bell hooks’ analysis of Black drag in the “Is
Paris Burning?” chapter of her 1996 book Reel to Real.
