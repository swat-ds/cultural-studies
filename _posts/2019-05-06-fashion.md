## Project Description

From our conclusion: "The dynamic and rapid evolution of styles and trends within the luxury fashion industry demonstrates the way in which fashion culture is influenced by subcultural groups and identities. Similarly, these subcultural groups also use fashion culture and style as a way of redefining and recreating their own subcultural identity. By analyzing the way in which the subculture of hip hop has integrated itself into the luxury fashion world, we can recognize how this subculture has used style and fashion to embrace their own authenticity and reflect upon their own subcultural histories and identities. By doing so, they were able to establish their own presence within the larger fashion culture, allowing for mainstream fashion to start embracing their notions of authenticity and cultural diversity."
