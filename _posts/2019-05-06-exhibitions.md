title: "The Museum Space as a Site of Counter-Hegemony (?)"
category: ['2019']
excerpt: 'While the museum has been traditionally associated with "high culture," we believe the museum provides multiple points of intervention for combatting the hegemonic ideologies promoted by the museum space and the artwork housed there. Our project focuses on the institution, the producer, and the consumer as three different sites for countering hegemony.'

> "Mundane Futures is the first chapter in the exhibition series Colored People Time and presents a small selection of black American projects that center the everyday within imaginings of a time that has yet to come." 
~ Meg Onli (Curator and Author) [^1]

In our exploration of *Colored People Time, Part One (Mundane Futures)*, we sought to investigate the museum space as a site of cultural production, consumption, and mediation. One can produce cultural creations by curating the museum space, consume cultural creations by visiting the museum space, and be mediated by the cultural creation of museum institutions themselves. In relation to these three points of cultural interaction, we specifically considered how and to what extent hegemonic ideologies[^2] are embedded within the physical museum space and the artworks displayed. Our concern with decolonizing the museum space also influenced our decision to display the museum digitally in our presentation. Our additional methodology included both background research in black curatorial studies and personal ethnography. We documented our respective experiences in the exhibit, keeping in mind how our positionalities influenced our experiences. Ultimately, this experience became an exercise in feeling the exhibition. As Ivan Karp says, “When people enter museums they do not leave their cultures and identities in the coatroom.”[^3] In totality, we’ve come to understand the museum as a site where hegemony (in many forms and systems) can be represented and challenged. Art and the places in which it is displayed have the potential to shape dominant forms of culture. We learned and interacted with the museum as a think tank[^4], critically engaging with the space in a way we had never done before.
