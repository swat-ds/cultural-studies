“What is Cultural Studies?” is a survey course in cultural studies methods and practices created by Prof. Bakirathi Mani at Swarthmore College.  The class is oriented as an introduction to the study of culture and power.  Focusing on fashion, music, debt, citizenship, art and performance, we explore a variety of approaches to reading and writing about the phenomenon that we call “culture.”  Highlighting queer, feminist, and trans theory by scholars of color, the course focuses on the production, circulation, and consumption of a variety of cultural texts.

The questions that motivate our readings include: How do forms of “high” and “low” culture reflect differences of race, class, sexuality and gender? What role do aesthetic and material objects play in historical and political movements? Why should we learn to read visual, aural, and social texts, and in what ways?  Literary close reading is at the basis of our work, but we also work in tandem with ethnography and historical analysis.  

We invite you to explore the student-led collaborative projects that emerged over the course of the semester.  Each project focuses on a single cultural object, but develops a wide range of analytical methods.  What feelings do visitors to a museum exhibit experience, and how do these feelings impact the ways they understand artworks?  How is multiculturalism performed and embodied in contemporary  dance? And why do we use Tinder as a way of curating our desires?

Our interdisciplinary work is informed by the visual scholar Irit Rogoff, who notes: “You don’t spend your life saying, ‘In sociology we do this, but in anthropology we do that; in literary criticism this, but in art history that.’ You get on with it. And you produce an undisciplined field that is a zone of dis-identification and immensely productive.”

***Spring 2019***

- **Abigail Bautista  ('22)** Even before I became a K-Pop fan in 2014, I was always fascinated with the organized structure of music production and circulation in Korean pop culture. For me, what makes K-Pop such an intriguing site for cultural studies is its ambiguous position in how South Korea creates its national brand domestically and internationally. South Korea’s national brand is built on clashing forces of tradition and modernity, Eastern and Western, convention and transgression; it is interesting to see how these forces interact from a cultural studies perspective."
- **Amanda Carrillo-Perez ('19)** is a Biology and Sociology/Anthropology double major. Amanda is interested in pursuing a master's in public health, and working to reduce health disparities through policy change.
- **David Chan (DJ) ('19)** I became a fan only three years ago, and I was initially drawn into the fandom because of the stunning music videos and the choreographies. It's like a snowball effect—once I started listening to one group, I kept discovering new groups that I also liked. It wasn't until later on that I discovered that K-pop resonates with a lot of Asian Americans. This made me think about the production of K-pop vs. the consumption of K-pop and what gets translated and what gets transformed. With that in mind, I wanted to see what we would discover if we studied K-pop from a cultural studies perspective."
- **Esther Couch ('21)** is an English and Spanish major that is unsure of what the difference between yams and sweet potatoes is, but is too afraid to ask at this point.
- **Bria Dinkins ('21)** is from West Chester, PA. She is majoring in Sociology/Anthropology with potential minor combinations in Art History, Film & Media Studies or Interpretation Theory.
- **Karen Guo ('22)** I have always been exposed to K-pop and although I am not a fan of any group in particular, it has been interesting to observe the rise in popularity of K-pop globally within these past few years and the change/lack of change within the industry over time. Only have recently begun listening to MAMAMOO, they have quickly become a favorite of mine and found out why they appealed to me so much after finishing this project."
- **Emilie Hautemont ('20)** is an Honors French major and English minor. She specializes in postcolonial literature and is particularly interested in gender and sexuality. Her interest in Cultural Studies was sparked by constant traveling between the U.S, where she was raised, and France, where her larger family resides. She is new to the world of Drag Race and finds RuPaul slightly terrifying."
- **Natasha Lodhi ('19)** is majoring in Economics with a minor in Mathematics. She decided to take this class on “What is Cultural Studies” as a way of further understanding how to view certain ideas and concepts embedded in our societal structures as objects of cultural study. She hopes to pursue a career in the fashion industry and she is fortunate to have taken this class as a way to further explore fashion as a cultural object."
- **Elisabeth Miller ('21)** is an English and history major. She will be abandoning Esther Couch to study abroad during the Fall ‘19 semester.
- **Jasmine Moore ('20)** is a special major in Food Studies and minor in Environmental Studies. Outside of academics, her interests include film, fashion and history."

- **Naomi Park ('21)** is from Flushing, NY. She is majoring in English Literature and minoring in Computer Science.
- **Emma Pernudi-Moon ('19)** is an English major and Theater minor. She is interested in performance, representation, and how subjects of color contest with white supremacist ways of seeing. She wonders if these contestations can be accurately theorized from her position as a non-Black scholar and invites additional interventions. She has watched 14 seasons of Drag Race and is working on her 15th."
- **Anjali Singapur ('21)** is a political science and sociology/anthropology major.
- **Isabelle Titcomb ('22)** is from Holden, Massachusetts. She runs cross-country at Swarthmore and is a potential film & media studies major."
