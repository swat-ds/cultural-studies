<p>How do we study culture?  Students in the class worked in pairs and groups to create an interdisciplinary final project, choosing both a single cultural text: fashion, photography, online dating, reality tv.

Their research culminated in these online platforms and an in-class presentation as well as reflective essay.</p>
